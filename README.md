### Product Cards
The following application was built as part of a study group assignment at NSS. Each individual created an app, but groups had the same specifications and collaboratively discussed styling, methods, and challenges. The assignment applied our newly-acquired knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
 
### Motivation/Purpose
The purpose of the app is to display available product cards with pertinent information for prospective buyers: images of available products, descriptions, availability, pricing, etc.
